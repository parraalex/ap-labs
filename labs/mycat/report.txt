REPORT OF TEST:
- Device: my operative system: macOS
- Sample: text.txt
- Time for mycat.: 0.000306
- Time for defcat: 0.001416

- Device: ap-labs linux OS
- Sample: text.txt
- Time for mycat.: 0.000492
- Time for defcat: 0.000649

Conclusion: it depends on how each operative system works, because on the test in macOS, the mycat was quicker than the default, but on virtualbox it was the opposite.
